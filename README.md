# Hand-Gesture-Controlled-Servo-System-Python-RISC-V-Arduino-
This project uses MediaPipe and OpenCV to track hand gestures in real time and send corresponding finger angles over a serial connection to a RISC-V microcontroller. The microcontroller, programmed using both Arduino C and RISC-V assembly, drives PWM signals to control servo motors based on detected finger movements
